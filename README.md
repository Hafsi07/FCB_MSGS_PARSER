This is a simple tool to parse facebook messages in json format. 

If you didn't know, you can download your facebook data including your messages, media, ads preference, settings.... You can download all the data or specify what data to download and also select the period in which that data was obtained. 

You can choose to download only messages and you'll obtain json files in conversation folders. 

If you do so, you can employ this script to obtain the messages to get all the information available in a structured format ready for any type of NLP analysis. 
Data will contain :
- Conversation ID, generated based on conversations participants and it will be the same if you have many files for the same conversation.
- Message, text sent.
- Timestamp, time the message was sent.
- Sender, name of the person who sent the message.
- Reactions, the reactions to this message.

Later you can choose which format or what data to keep. 
Note that you can choose which users to exclude or include in your conversations and that you have to select json format when requesting your files from FCB.
Facebook messages are a great source for authentic accurate linguistic data to capture dialects like the native speak it.
